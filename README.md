# breeze.
an indev ubg project made in astro because:
1. i haven't used astro in so long and needed to exercise my skills
2. i needed a clean ubg site to use
3. i kinda wanted some movies on my school chromebook
4. i have nothing else to work on
5. i got mad at nautilusos because something wouldnt work, so what better to do than use typescript instead of js
